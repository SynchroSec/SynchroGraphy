💎 Synchro Security | Cryptography Tool
A feature-rich desktop application for encryption and decryption using various algorithms, built with customtkinter, cryptography, and pycryptodome.

🔐 Features
Supports multiple encryption algorithms:

AES (with key derivation)

XOR

SHA-256 / SHA-1 / MD5 (one-way hashes)

Base64

Hex

Caesar Cipher

ROT13

Fernet (symmetric)

Blowfish

TripleDES

Key-based encryption where applicable

Password strength indicator

Light/Dark theme toggle

Clipboard copy functionality

Save encrypted output to file

Activity logging with timestamps

🖥️ GUI Built With
customtkinter (modern, themed tkinter)

Python standard libraries

cryptography and pycryptodome for secure encryption

🚀 Installation
Clone the repository (or copy the script):

git clone https://github.com/SynchroSec/SynchroGraphy.git
cd SynchroGraphy

Install dependencies:
pip install customtkinter cryptography pycryptodome

usage : 

python SynchroGraphy.py

Then:

Enter your text and encryption key.

Choose your encryption type from the dropdown.

Click 🔒 Encrypt or 🔓 Decrypt as needed.

View, copy, or save the results.

📁 Output
Encrypted text can be:

Displayed in the output box

Copied to clipboard

Saved to a timestamped .txt file

🛡️ Security Notes
AES uses PBKDF2HMAC for strong key derivation with a random salt and IV.

Fernet uses autogenerated keys.

Hash algorithms are one-way and not decryptable.

🧪 Password Strength
Displays password strength as:

Weak

Medium

Strong
(based on length and character variety)
